# The Ant Farm

The Ant Farm is a program that aims to simplify the process of PCB-making using CNC machines.  
In this software we included both the necessary CAM features and the CNC machine control capabilities, trying to simplify the user operations as much as possible.  

# Actual status  
This software is a pre-alpha, meaning that not all the functionalities are implemented, and the implemented ones may not work or not work properly.  
The **View** tab can be used and it's capable to generate gcode files from gerbers.  
The **Control** tab is currently under development, and its functionalities may have some issues.  
The **Align** tab is not developed at all.  
Up to now, the application is compatible only with CNC machines using GRBL v1.1 firmware, and it has been tested using only some gerber and drill files generated using Autodesk's Eagle and KiCad EDA.  
If you want to have some more information about the actual implemented features, you could watch this video:

# Getting started  
  
## Prerequisites  

The application requires an installation of python version 3.7 or greater.  

## Installation  
  
The python packages needed are listed in the file "requirements.txt", that could be used to install them by command line.  
The cleanest way to install these packages is using a virtual environment.

### Linux  

Either download the zip of the repository sources or use git:  
  
> git clone https://github.com/TheAntTeam/TheAntFarm.git  

Enter the folder where there is the code, create a virtual environment and activate it:  
  
> cd TheAntFarm  
> python3 -m venv ./env  
  
Activate the virtual environment:  
    
> source ./env/bin/activate

Install all the required packages:
  
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt  

It could be also necessary to install an additional library:
  
> sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0  
  
### Troubleshooting  
  
In some linux distribution the access to usb serial port may be denied (permission denied).  
In this case, a possible solution may be to add your user to the *dialout* group and disable the *modemmanager* service at startup.  
To add your user to the dialout group you may use the following command:  

> sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER  
  
To check that your user has been added to the *dialout* group run this command:  
  
> groups ${USER}
  
To disable the *modemmanager* service run:  
  
> systemctl disable ModemManager.service  
  
For this last modification to be effective, you may need to reboot.  

### Windows  

Either download the zip of the repository sources or use git:  
  
> git clone https://github.com/TheAntTeam/TheAntFarm.git  

Enter the folder where there is the code, create a virtual environment and activate it:  
  
> cd TheAntFarm    
> python3 -m venv .\env  
  
Activate the virtual environment:  
  
> .\env\Scripts\activate  
  
Install all the required packages:
  
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt  

### Windows using VS Code

Either download the zip of the repository sources or use git:  
  
> git clone https://github.com/TheAntTeam/TheAntFarm.git  

In VS Code

* File -> Open Folder -> open the TheAntFarm Folder

* Terminal -> New Terminal (This will probably open a Powershell, which is what we will use)

In the Terminal:

> python -m venv .\venv  (You may have to install python3 globaly)

* Restart VS code
  
Activate the virtual environment:  
  
> .\venv\Scripts\activate

* Open the_ant_farm.py, in the bottom right of the interface it should say "Python", next to it should be the python verion number folled by 'venv'/venv, if not click it and change the interpreter.
  
Install all the required packages:

> "path"\TheAntFarm\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
  
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt  

## Running the software  
  
The software must be run from the project directory, after the virtual environment has been activated (see installation paragraph), using the following command:

> python .\the_ant_farm.py
